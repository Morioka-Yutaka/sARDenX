## `%sard_stats_fisher_test()` macro <a name="sardstatsfishertest-macro-1"></a> ######

Purpose:
  Performs Fisher's exact test for a 2x2 (or RxC) contingency table by
  aggregating counts and calling PROC FREQ with the FISHER option.
  The macro returns ARD-style p-value and method/alternative metadata.

Inputs:
  data      - Input dataset.
  classdata - Optional CLASSDATA= dataset for PROC SUMMARY (formats/order).
  group     - Row (grouping) variable for the contingency table.
  var       - Column (categorical) variable for the contingency table.
  side      - Alternative hypothesis:
              2 or B = two-sided (default),
              L      = one-sided (lower/left tail),
              U or R = one-sided (upper/right tail).

Outputs:
  out       - Output dataset in ARD-style structure with:
              - method (Fisher's Exact Test)
              - alternative (two.sided / less / greater)
              - p.value (exact Fisher p-value)

Notes:
  - The meaning of "less" and "greater" depends on the ordering of
    levels in &group and &var as used in TABLES &group * &var.
  - Missing values in &group or &var are excluded unless PROC SUMMARY
    is modified with MISSING.
  - Intermediate datasets are created in WORK and deleted at the end.

Example:
  %sard_stats_fisher_test(
    data=ADSL,
    out=sard_stats_fisher_test,
    group=TRT01PN,
    var=SEX,
    side=2
  );

## `%sard_stats_t_test()` macro <a name="sardstatsttest-macro-2"></a> ######

Purpose:
  Performs a two-sample t-test using PROC TTEST and returns ARD-style results.
  The macro outputs group means, confidence intervals, and test statistics
  in a standardized long-format dataset.

Inputs:
  data      - Input dataset.
  class     - Grouping (classification) variable with two levels.
  var       - Numeric analysis variable.
  alpha     - Significance level for confidence intervals (default: 0.05).
  side      - Test type for PROC TTEST:
              2 = two-sided (default),
              L = one-sided lower-tail,
              U/R = one-sided upper-tail.
  h0        - Null hypothesis mean difference (default: 0).
  Welch     - Whether to use Welch/Satterthwaite method:
              Y = Welch t-test (default),
              N = Pooled-variance t-test.

Outputs:
  out       - Output dataset in ARD-style structure with:
              - estimate / conf.low / conf.high for each group mean
              - estimate1 / estimate2 for group-specific means
              - t statistic, degrees of freedom, p-value
              - method, alternative, conf.level, mu, var.equal, paired

Notes:
  - Assumes exactly two groups in &class.
  - One-sided direction depends on the ordering of CLASS levels in PROC TTEST.
  - Intermediate datasets are created in WORK and deleted at the end.

Example:
  %sard_stats_t_test(
    data=ADSL,
    out=sard_stats_t_test,
    class=TRT01PN,
    var=AGE,
    alpha=0.05,
    side=2,
    h0=0,
    Welch=Y
  );
